											<p align = "justify">Throughout high school, computers were still relatively new, I remember learning to type on electric typewriters, and the school only had eight computers in the entire school. As far as career choices, computer-related careers were only just out of their infancy, though I could see it was the future and wanted to study computer science at Uni. When I completed my HSC/VCE (it was still going through the name change) in 1988, it didn't matter how well you did in your studies if you failed English, you failed your HSC/VCE. I had a complete mental blank in my English exam and only managed three-quarters of a page on my essays, needless to say, I failed.</p>
											<p align = "justify">First-round university offers came and went, so I decided to return to high school to repeat my HSC/VCE. Halfway through the year, I had a significant car accident and decided to leave school and work full time to pay off my debts, the university was on ice and thirty plus year career in retail commenced. At the end of 2019, I felt that I no longer had the passion to "walk the shop tiles" of the supermarket and began looking for alternative directions for the final trimester of my working career.</p>

											<h2 class="major" align = "justify">Looking for a career change.</h2>
											<p align = "justify">I reached out to several friends and colleagues I know working in the IT Sector, in particular those that deal with SAP. The advice that I received was I could learn SAP online, and with my experience as an end-user in many SAP platforms, that I would run rings around many of their current team. The issue was, I require a degree in either finance or human resources to pursue this change in direction. So, after thirty years, I have recommenced studying and enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce with Curtin University through Open University Australia. The opportunity arose when a role became available in our finance division as a commercial analyst. Not only was I successful in applying for this role, but the business also agreed to support me in obtaining my Bachelor of Commerce.</p>
											<p align = "justify">Over the last fifteen years, I have worked in many roles involving analytics. As part of my current position, I write large volumes of reports, many repetitive each week and have developed a fascination of trying to automate as many pieces as possible. My real interest in IT rekindled as I watched in awe at our teams working with Robotics and AI. Wanting to take my role in this direction, I enrolled in Introduction to IT at RMIT as one of my elective subjects. I am sure this will not be the last.</p>
											<p align = "justify">Like most people, I work daily with the Microsoft Office Suite, along with the Google Suite. My expanded knowledge has been as an end-user of SAP BW, SAP R3, SAP WEBI, TM1, KRONOS, in financial reporting. I dabbled a little in Java Scripting and SQL Developer to automate interactive PDF's about ten years ago and this year as the business moved to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Tableau and Big Query; I have ramped up my SQL scripting skills. </p>
											<p align = "justify">When looking for subjects to study as electives, my instinct was to look for courses that would lend to my desire to learn Robotics and AI. As I searched the topics, one common theme kept coming up, RMIT. I enrolled in the course Introduction to IT in study period 4, 2020â€”Year of the lockdown. I am looking for this subject as a launching place to other subjects to complete as electives to support my career move away from the shop floor, into finance in the twenty-first century.</p></p>

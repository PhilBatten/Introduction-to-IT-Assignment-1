											<p align = "justify">Whilst having the ability to work well in a team supporting my colleagues, there are times requiring reflection on the situations where workflows are note restricted by being fixated on a particular course of actions. Whilst having the ability to think strategically and out of the box, there is also the underlying desire to work within a comfort zone that may not be conducive to the desired outcome. The ideal position for myself based on these results is one that forms part of a team, where the opportunities exist to support and coach other parts of the team along the way.</p>
											<p align = "justify">The DDI report an example of how these reports can identify strengths and weaknesses, providing the candidate with the ability to form a development plan, that is, provided the candidate is made aware of the results.</p>
											<p align = "justify">Utilising the results of such tests allows managers to put teams together that will work well together, identifying potential leaders, strategic thinkers, coaches, and general strong work ethics, forming a team that works well together. For example, my place in an ideal team would be to support a leader and help coach other team members to ensure everyone keeps up together.</p>

											<h3>]Defender Personality |ISFJ-A / ISFJ-T.</h3>
											<p align = "justify">The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.</p>
											<blockquote>Defenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity.</blockquote>
											<p align = "justify">Defender personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. Defenders take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home.</p>

				<h2>Phil Batten</h2>
				<h2 class="major">Project Idea: Use-by Date Tracker.</h2>


<!-- Overview-->

					<h3 class="major">Overview.</h3>
					<p align = "justify">The development of an app for your phone or tablet for tracking use-by dates of consumable products in your pantry, fridge or freezer, by simply scanning the barcode of the product, or manually entering the details, and then recording the use-by date by taking a photo of the date on the product or manually entering.</p>
					<p align = "justify">The app then provides a list of products at the commencement of each week that will go out of date that week. It will also offer reminder notifications at three days, two days and date of expiry until acknowledged that the product has been consumed or disposed along with an option to add the product to your shopping list.</p>

<!-- Motivatiojn -->

					<h3 class="major">Motivation.</h3>
					<p align = "justify">Are you sick and tired of throwing good food out because it went out of date before you got around to consuming it? Having worked three decades in supermarket retail industry, I have seen first-hand how this is an exorbitant cost to a business, that consumers also face within their kitchens if we don't keep track of the use-by dates. Each week I watch as my partner stands at the fridge expressing expletives as she throws unopened food out that has expired without realising it was short on a use-by date, complaining of the cost of food that has gone in the bin.</p>
					<p align = "justify">In Australia, we waste approximately 7.3 million tonnes of food, the equivalent of twenty per cent of all bags of groceries. Although this figure includes product that never leaves the farm, we all need to do our bit, as we need to consider what went into producing the products wasted such as Water, livestock and greenhouse emissions.(Australian Government - Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020)</p>

<!-- Description. -->
					<h3 class="major" class="wrapper alt style1">Description.</h3>
						<p align = "justify">The project will consist of developing an app for the smartphone or tablet using the device's camera to scan the barcode. The app will then reference a database of barcodes to identify the product. If the product is unknown, the details can be manually entered and then stored to the database for future reference.</p>
			 			<p align = "justify">Once identified, the app will then ask you to enter the use-by date and the quantity that you have. You then save your entry before moving on to the next product. When entering the details of each product, the storage location is also captured, such as pantry, fridge, freezer or even bathroom (medicinal products).</p>
						<p align = "justify">For the app to be successful, it will be necessary to source a database of barcodes for consumable products, initially in Australia, ultimately the world.</p>
						<p align = "justify">At the commencement of each week, the app would produce a list of all consumable products that are store in the app and have a use-by date that will expire in the next seven days. This list will appear sorted into firstly the location where the product is stored, and then in date order of expiry. Provided sufficient information is available, there is also potential to sort the list into consumable type. For example, like spices, pasta, biscuits etc. and potentially where they should be stored, e.g., most people keep the sauce in the pantry, despite the label stating to keep refrigerated once open.</p>
						<p align = "justify">The user can grant access for the app to send notifications to the user, the app can send reminders at a designated time that a product is down to three days left, two days left, or due to expire today. Notification frequency will be an option within the setting of the application. Once consumed or disposed of the user will acknowledge this in the application, removing it from the app, the lists and notifications. When removing the product from the app, you will be asked if you wish to add the product to your shopping list.</p>

<!-- Tools and Technologies. -->
					<h3 class="major">Tools and Technologies.</h3>
					<p>Several different areas will need to collaborate to make this app successful.
						<ul><li>The application will require the programming skills and open-source access to the necessary databases for details of products and their barcodes.
						<li>Smartphones and tablets camera technology allows them to read QR codes; however, by default, they are unable to read barcodes. The app will need to include the programming to enable the camera to read barcodes on the consumable products.
						<li>Programming will also need to include the ability to convert the image of text to a date format when taking a photo of a use-by date to enter.
						<li>Newer 19 digit barcodes often found on products such as meat, will include additional information including the weight of within the packaging and if programmed by the vendors, use-by dates
						<li>Although we can build into the application a shopping list functionality, the ultimate user experience would be that the option to add to shopping list, would include the ability to add to your shopping list on the apps of the major supermarkets such as Woolworths and Coles.
						<li>The collaboration with Woolworths and Coles may not be able to be achieved initially and should form part of the long-term strategy of the application.</ul></p>

<!-- Tools and Technologies. -->
				<h3 class="major">Skills Required.</h3>
					<p>Essentially two skills required to develop this application. <br>
						1.	Software programming is compatible with both IOS and Android hardware.
						<ul><li>The ability will need to include programming the device to read barcodes.
						<li>The ability to decipher the barcodes including traditional 13-digit barcodes, abbreviated barcodes and the newer 19-digit and 21-digit barcodes.</ul>
						2.	Research skill to locate and access the necessary databases that contain information about the consumable products, in particular, their barcodes.</p>

<!-- Outcome. -->
				<h3 class="major">Outcome.</h3>
					<p align = "justify">The ultimate goal from the development of this application will be to reduce and eventually eliminate food waste in Australian households, and the benefits attached, such as reduced water consumption, and greenhouse emissions.</p><br><br>

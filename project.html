<!-- Family -->

					<h3 class="major">It's all about family and friends.</h3>
					<p>Living in Hoppers Crossing, Victoria, with my partner of 11 years (I hope I have that right), Veronica and our three children Tayla (17), Jai (19) and Brodie (21) and our dog Rocky (3). </p>
					<p>While Jai is a first-year apprentice electrician, Brodie and Tayla both have a rare condition known as an Arnold Chiari Malformation (severe) which has left them unable to walk or talk, and the mentality of a toddler. Their condition and custody arrangements with their mother prevent us from getting away as much as we like, so our other real passion is our house or our resort. We recently built our house to suit their needs, investing in this as our forever home and designed it as our little piece of paradise in the Western Suburbs of Melbourne.</p>

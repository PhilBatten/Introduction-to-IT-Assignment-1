									<h3 class="major">Lorem ipsum dolor</h3>
									<p>Living in Hoppers Crossing, Victoria, with my partner of 11 years (I hope I have that right), Veronica and our three children Tayla (17), Jai (19) and Brodie (21) and our dog Rocky (3). We love to get away camping three or four times per year, varying our locations from the coast to the country, with my favourite spot off the grid in the high-country Howqua Hills below Mount Buller.The perfect location to disconnect from the world and recharge the batteries. No power, no data, just you, the high country, the river and a campfire.</p>

									<p>While Jai is a first-year apprentice electrician, Brodie and Tayla both have a rare condition known as an Arnold Chiari Malformation (severe) which has left them unable to walk or talk, and the mentality of a toddler. Their condition and custody arrangements with their mother prevent us from getting away as much as we like, so our other real passion is our house or our resort. We recently built our house to suit their needs, investing in this as our forever home and designed it as our little piece of paradise in the Western Suburbs of Melbourne.</p>

								<p>It was really important to us, that if we could not get away for longer periods, that our time at home was just as relaxing as holidaying.</p>
								<p>Our house is set up with a large outdoor entertaining area that can be used all year round, plenty of grass for play, and swimming area for relaxing.</p>

								<p>Christmas is a time for coming together as a family. It can at times be hard work, but you need to invest in your family to stay connected. In this day and age, it is too easy to let things come between you and your family.</p>
								<p>We make sure Christmas is not only about the immediate family, but also about the extended family. Keeping traditions alive, with family gatherings that date back to before I was born.</p>
